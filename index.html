        <ul id="list">
            <li><strong>They Were Originally Herding Dogs</strong> – Despite their popularity in police and military work, GSDs were initially bred for herding sheep.</li>
            <li><strong>Their Bite Force is Stronger Than a Wolf’s</strong> – A German Shepherd has a bite force of around 238-291 PSI, which is stronger than some wild wolves!</li>
            <li><strong>They Can Learn Commands After Just 5 Repetitions</strong> – GSDs are among the smartest dog breeds and can understand new commands faster than most other dogs.</li>
            <li><strong>They Have Webbed Feet</strong> – Their slightly webbed feet help them swim and gain traction on rough terrains.</li>
            <li><strong>They Change Colors as They Grow</strong> – Many GSD puppies are born with lighter coats that darken over time. Some even change patterns as they mature.</li>
            <li><strong>They Are Prone to ‘Lean on You’</strong> – GSDs are known for leaning against their owners, which is a sign of trust and affection.</li>
            <li><strong>They Have a Double Coat</strong> – Their thick double coat helps them handle extreme weather conditions, but it also means they shed a LOT!</li>
            <li><strong>They Can be Trained for Almost Anything</strong> – GSDs excel in various fields, from search-and-rescue to therapy work, bomb detection, and even acting in movies.</li>
            <li><strong>They Are Super Loyal but Can Be Velcro Dogs</strong> – Once they bond with their owner, they prefer to stick close, often following their humans everywhere.</li>
            <li><strong>Their Ears Take Time to Stand Up</strong> – Not all GSD puppies have erect ears right away! It can take 5-6 months before their ears fully stand up, and some may never stand.</li>
        </ul>
